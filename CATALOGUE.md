# MCBedrockChestSortedOnSneakRightClick â€“ Feature Catalogue

## Overview
This Minecraft Bedrock script adds robust, cheat-free chest sorting for BDS and single-player. Sorts any inventory block (chest, barrel, etc.) by stacking and alphabetizing its contents, with advanced handling for special items and customizations.

## Features

- **Sneak-Click Sorting:**
  - Sneak (crouch) and right-click any inventory block to sort its contents.
- **Global Sorting Toggle:**
  - Operators can use `/sortanywhere` to allow sorting without sneaking.
- **Sorting Modes:**
  - Operators can use `/sortmode <alpha|count|type>` to change sorting order:
    - `alpha`: Alphabetical (default)
    - `count`: By item count (descending)
    - `type`: By item typeId
- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Sorting triggers happy villager particles and a level-up sound at the chest.
- **Performance Optimized:**
  - Efficient array operations and preallocation for large containers.
- **Special Item Handling:**
  - Correctly distinguishes potions, tipped arrows, suspicious stew, fireworks, books, banners, player heads, maps, enchanted books, shulker boxes, and any item with enchantments, custom names, or lore.
- **Rollback on Error:**
  - If sorting fails (e.g., due to item loss), the chest is rolled back and a precise diff is shown.
- **Operator-Only Commands:**
  - Only players with the `operator` tag can use `/sortanywhere` and `/sortmode`.

## Commands

### /sortanywhere
Toggles whether sneaking is required to trigger sorting. Only available to operators.

**Usage:**
```
/sortanywhere
```
Toggles between requiring sneaking and allowing sorting on any right-click.

### /sortmode <alpha|count|type>
Changes the sorting mode for all players. Only available to operators.

**Usage:**
```
/sortmode alpha   # Alphabetical (default)
/sortmode count   # By item count (descending)
/sortmode type    # By item typeId
```

## Visual Feedback
- Sorting a chest triggers happy villager particles and a level-up sound at the chest location.

## Permissions
- Only players with the `operator` tag can use `/sortanywhere` and `/sortmode`.

## Error Handling
- If sorting fails (e.g., due to item loss or mismatch), the chest is rolled back to its previous state and a detailed error is shown in chat.

## Performance
- Sorting is optimized for large containers using preallocated arrays and efficient sorting algorithms.

## Extending
- The script is designed to be maintainable and extensible. See `getStackKey` for how special items are handled.
